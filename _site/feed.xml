      Introduction


Hello again. Today I will be looking into a medium box based on active directory from HackTheBox made by egre55. 

This box starts with an easy foothold. The password is retrieved from RPC which gives us initial access. Then we move over to ryan user which is a part of DNS Admins group that has a priv esc route. Lets get into it.

Enumeration
Nmap scan shows a lot of ports open. ...

      Introduction


This is an easy room on HackMyVM made by sml. You can find this room at Doc - HackMyVM.

This is also a boot2root machine with a lot of rabit holes and can really cause a headache if you’re too focused. But fortunately didnt happen with me by chance. Starts off with a book store what has default creds and a shell being uploaded to the website. Getting in it was pretty easy to get SSH...
