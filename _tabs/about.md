Hey everyone! I'm Ahmed Sher otherwise known as Ace or crypt0ace. I'm a Cyber Security Nerd who loves to learn, break in and hack. I play a lot of Capture the Flag (CTFs) competitions with my team [We Need Control](https://ctftime.org/team/163080). I also play TryHackMe and HackTheBox, Always learning cool new things. I'm more interested in Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering side of the CTFs. You can find my Walkthroughs of TryHackMe and HackTheBox machines, Write-Ups of CTFs I participate in and more great content right here on my blog.
